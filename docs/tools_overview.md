# Tools Overview :construction_site:

normalMagic is comprised of several tools. Some modify normals, some modify geometry and normals, and some visualize normals and related attributes.

!!! warning "Custom Normals"
    Most of these tools create or edit ***custom normals***. These can be unintuitive to work with if you're unfamiliar
    Once custom normals exist on a mesh, some default Blender tools/modifiers might not behave as expected. 
    Tools are included to fix situations such as [mirroring](normal_tools/repair_mirrored_normals.md) or [beveling](normal_tools/repair_bevel_normals.md) but it's something to be aware of.
