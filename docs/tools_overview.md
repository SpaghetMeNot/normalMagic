# Tools Overview
!!! info "Custom Normals"
    Most of these tools create or edit ***custom normals***. These can be unintuitive to work with if you're unfamiliar.

    Once custom normals exist on a mesh, some default Blender tools/modifiers might not behave as expected. 
    Tools are included to fix situations such as [mirroring](normal_tools/repair_mirrored_normals.md) or [beveling](normal_tools/repair_bevel_normals.md) but it's something to be aware of.

## Asset Library
The core of normalMagic is an asset library. You'll find links to all the tools in the sidebar under the following categories:

- [Mesh Modifiers](./mesh_tools/index.md)
- [Normal Modifiers](./normal_tools/index.md)
- [Visualize Modifiers](./visualize_tools/index.md)
- [Other Modifiers](./other_tools/index.md)
- [Manual Tools](./manual_tools/index.md)

## Add-on
Included with the Pro version, the add-on makes it easier to set up some of the modifiers.
